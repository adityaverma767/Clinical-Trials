The study includes 160 participants with T2D, aged 40-75, who will be randomly assigned to either the control group (standard physician-guided prescriptions) or the AI-guided group (prescriptions determined by GenAIS, an AI system by Triangel Scientific). The primary objective is to compare the reduction in HbA1c levels between the two groups over 6 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in fasting glucose, lipid profiles, body weight, BMI, hsCRP levels, and adherence to the dietary supplement regimen. The AI system integrates genetic, metabolic, and clinical data to provide personalized supplement recommendations, aiming to improve glycemic control and overall metabolic health."

The data included all inpatient episodes from acute care hospitals. The study focused on mortality rates associated with total pancreatectomy and examined how these rates varied with the complexity of the surgeries and the volume of procedures performed by different hospitals.\n\nThe mortality rates for total pancreatectomy in Germany were found to be more than three times higher than those reported by specialized pancreatic centers. Mortality rates increased significantly with the complexity of the total pancreatectomy procedures, especially those involving arterial resections. Hospitals with lower total pancreatectomy caseloads had higher mortality rates compared to high-volume centers.\n\nResults showed that total pancreatectomies are associated with high mortality rates, particularly in hospitals with lower surgical volumes. The findings suggest that the promising outcomes from specialized centers cannot be generalized to all hospitals performing pancreatic surgeries, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of the learning curve and specialization in pancreatic surgery to reduce mortality risks."

Does self-PNF stretching have an effect on respiratory functions in caregivers of children with developmental delays? The questions were answered.",

Using the online randomization method, caregivers were first assigned to either the PNF stretching group or the static stretching group. Before and after the application, rib cage mobility was evaluated by chest circumference measurement, hamstring muscle mobility by popliteal angle measurement, lumbar region mobility by Schober Test, posterior muscle chain mobility by Finger-Floor Distance Measurement Test, and respiratory functions by Respiratory Function Test. The caregiver, who entered a 1-day cleansing period, repeated the evaluation and technique application with the stretching technique that was not applied the next day."

The muscle to be stretched (the antagonist muscle for the pattern - the muscle that causes the limitation) was first brought to the position where it could be extended, and at that point, the stretched muscle was contracted submaximally (65% of the intensity determined according to the Stretch Intensity Scale) for 5 seconds, causing isometric contraction. Then, the athlete was given 5 relax commands for the tense muscle. Then, the stretched muscle was stretched as far as it could go, and the muscle that needed to be stretched was passively stretched for 20 seconds (1 set). After a 5-second rest interval, the method was repeated and 8 sets (lasting 4 minutes) were performed for 1 muscle. Stretching was done on the hamstring muscle.",

              "DetailedDescription": "Football (Soccer) is very a popular game and is played for both leisure and professional occupation. Soccer that is one of the contact game and the main portion of the players life is mostly spend on the sport ground in circumstances where there is a great risk of physical injury. Soccer player requires to be fit physically and mentally in order to cater the outstanding demands of game and training which includes the exceptional levels of attention, memory, and planning, and other diverse mental roles though good proprioception is a vital prerequisite for a good game performance and locomotor system injuries and mild traumatic brain injury. The ankle is contemplated majorly susceptible joint to injure throughout games. About 30% of games injuries including running, contact, and jumping are ankle injuries, and ankle ligamentous injuries account for 77% of ankle injuries. Repetitive occurrence of ankle ligamentous injuries cause prolong injury in the sensory-motor function and proprioceptive, by creating a deficit in the Neuro-muscular reflex response time. In 20% of the cases, repeated ankle ligamentous events can result in unstableness of the ankle joints.\n\nMotor imagery is an active procedure during which the representation of an exact action is internally reproduced within the working memory, deprived of any motor output. Evidence has been presented by Functional imaging studies that during motor imagery like anatomical substrates get activated as during motor performance and exercise, motor imagery has been indicated to boost motor performance and muscle potential. Imagery has also been mentioned to be an effectual adjunctive procedure to physiotherapy programs. The imagery program is utilized to assist members to control, see, and vividly construct an image with in the mind. Motor imagery method form a nerve network, hence motor images boost dynamic balancing capability by facilitation the coordination, proprioceptive sense, and kinesthesia capability. Besides, other researchers have described reduction in pain when imagery has been implemented to other medical disorders.\n\nA study reported that a therapy plus imagery group had better functional retrieved than a control therapy group, during imagery there are extensive activation of neural and muscular mechanisms as if the arm were actually being utilized. Motor imagery was effectual by indicating slow down onset time of peroneal muscle in patients with functional ankle unstableness. MI may be effective for pain relief and development in range of motion among prolong musculoskeletal discomfort condition. MI protocol can be helpful to rehabilitation plans after total knee arthroplasty, as it mainly aids to reduce uneasiness and increase strength. For patients who have had arthroplasty, this pilot study advises that MI therapy should be comprised to the orthopedic treatment. We observed at a few developments brought about by MI on motor retrieval following peripheral injury, mostly in the initial postop phase. Plantar-flexor muscles" voluntary torque cohort was importantly increased by MI training of lower limb muscles, and this force surge was not the result of general motivational effects. When it comes to the rehabilitation of grade II ankle ligamentous tears, MI might be useful.\n\nThe management of MSK pain situations has seen a rise in the application of MI in modern years. This study aimed to relating the consequence of motor imagery as an adjunct to standard rehab (intervention) and with standard rehab only (comparison) on ankle pain, instability, strength, proprioception (outcomes) in soccer player with acute lateral ankle sprain (participants). This will help set the foundation for further study and designing treatment protocols of the said population."

Their voice will be analyzed by machine learning models that predict the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. The models" performance will be compared to the clinician assessments and how that correlation compares to a similar comparison between the clinician assessments with the self reported surveys. It is hypothesized that the performance of the machine learning models in assessing the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms is no worse than the self reported surveys when both are compared to clinician assessments. It is also hypothesized that presence or absence of the diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder can be predicted better than chance by the analysis of the participant"s voice sample using machine learning models."

The program integrates these approaches to provide dual-layer support, addressing individual thought patterns and family dynamics, thus potentially reducing anxiety and increasing mindfulness among students. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the program"s effectiveness in a controlled setting, contributing to both national and international literature on mental health interventions.",
              "DetailedDescription": "This research was conducted as a pre-test, post-test randomized controlled study to determine the effects of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based Family Counseling Program on anxiety and mindfulness levels in university students experiencing future anxiety. The study collected data from 20 students, divided equally between 10 participants in the intervention group and 10 in the control group. Data were gathered using a Personal Characteristics Form, the Future Anxiety Scale for University Students, and the Turkish version of the Mindfulness Awareness Scale for Adolescents and Adults.\n\nThe intervention group participated in an online CBT-based Family Counseling Program, which was conducted weekly for 8 weeks, each session lasting between 50-60 minutes. For the first 6 weeks, the sessions included only the students, while the last two weeks also involved family members" participation. No intervention was applied to the control group. Both groups were assessed with the aforementioned scales before the intervention and after its conclusion. This study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of integrating family dynamics into therapeutic practices for reducing anxiety and enhancing mindfulness among students."

              "BriefSummary": "This retrospective cohort study aims to describe the current FLT3 testing landscape in Taiwan. It includes two patient groups: non-M3 primary AML patients with relapsed/refractory disease (R/R cohort) and newly diagnosed non-M3 primary AML patients (newly diagnosed cohort).\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\nEstimate FLT3 testing turnaround time in clinical practice. Assess FLT3 clonal evolution in the R/R cohort.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nDetermine FLT3 mutation prevalence. Describe karyotypes, co-mutations, and allelic ratios in both cohorts. Study European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk in the newly diagnosed cohort. Evaluate the association of FLT3 mutation changes with treatment discontinuation and overall survival (OS) in the R/R cohort.\n\nInvestigate the link between Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) outcomes with treatment discontinuation and OS in the newly diagnosed cohort.\n\nData from the National Taiwan University Hospital integrated Medical Database (NTUH-iMD) and NTUH-AML dataset will be used. The index date is the earliest R/R AML evidence for the R/R cohort and the initial AML diagnosis date for the newly diagnosed cohort. A three-year baseline period will provide patient history and comorbidity information. Patients will be followed until the study"s end, loss to follow-up, or death.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of hematological diseases. According to the Taiwan Cancer Registry Annual Report, 859 new AML cases were diagnosed in Taiwan in 2018, with an age-standardized incidence rate of 3.06 in males and 2.18 in females per 100,000 person-years.\n\nThe FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3) affects the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells. FLT3 mutations are found in 25-30% of newly diagnosed AML patients and are considered a negative prognostic factor, remaining significant even after intensive chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplant.\n\nTwo critical issues for ensuring timely targeted therapy for FLT3+ patients are the speed of FLT3 test turnaround and the use of tests at key time points. Rapid turnaround times are necessary for early intervention, with European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommending results within 3 days. However, it"s unclear if this is achievable in real-world settings. FLT3 mutation status evolves, with 15-25% of patients losing and 13% acquiring the mutation at relapse. Despite guidelines recommending FLT3 testing at diagnosis and relapse, there is no consensus in Taiwan on its importance and timing.\n\nSome observational studies on AML in Taiwan have been conducted but provide limited information on the timing and turnaround of FLT3 testing in real-world practice.\n\nThis study will describe the current FLT3 testing landscape, including turnaround time and timing of tests among adult relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients at NTUH. It will also investigate the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of both adult R/R AML and newly diagnosed AML patients."

              "BriefSummary": "The course of coronavirus infection was often severe and required hospitalization of patients in the intensive care unit. The new SARS-Cov-2 has been poor studied, so relatively reliable markers are needed to effectively monitor patients and predict complications and outcome. Taking into account the known mechanisms of pathogenesis, the biochemical markers as ferritin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and D-dimer were chosen for this purpose. Patients were divided according to the degree of pulmonary infiltration. We hypothesized that the markers would correlate with dynamics, complications, and outcomes.",
              "DetailedDescription": "In the presented study, an analysis of the medical records of 193 patients hospitalized in severe condition to the intensive care unit with a confirmed diagnosis of Coronavirus infection COVID-19 was carried out. Taking into account the volume of pulmonary infiltration according to computer tomography (CT) of the chest organs, patients were divided into 4 groups in accordance with the approved classification: CT 1(up to 25% of lung tissue was infiltrated) - 27 patients, CT 2 (25-50%) - 60 patients, CT 3 (50-75%) - 67 patients, CT 4 (75% and more) - 39 patients. The following biochemical parameters were selected and used to monitor dynamics: procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer (DD), ferritin (FRT). The duration of observation was 15 days.\n\nIn order to determine correlations between quantitative and qualitative data at different stages of treatment, a correlation analysis was carried out (Spearman"s test was used). ROC analysis was performed to evaluate selected laboratory markers as predictors of outcome. Next, the odds ratio (OR) was assessed taking into account the obtained Youden"s J index and the Associated criterion for each of the selected markers in relation to the patient"s outcome. Preliminary contingency tables were compiled in relation to laboratory parameters and outcomes (2x2 tables).\n\nData were processed using statistical software jamovi (Computer Software ,Version 2.3.26), MedCalc (MedCalc Software Ltd, Ostend, Belgium), Microsoft Office Excel, 2016."

The patients are randomized to either treatment with Botulinum toxin type A or placebo Two patients in the primary treatment group will receive Botulinum toxin type A at their first injection at inclusion, while the two patients in the secondary treatment group will receive normal saline (placebo) as their first injection at inclusion. At 6 weeks follow up, the primary treatment group will receive their second injection of Botulinum toxin type A and the secondary treatment group now will receive their second injection, but this will be their first injection of Botulinum toxin type A.\n\nBy using the described study-design, all participating soldiers will get treatment. However, the secondary treatment group will have a delayed onset of treatment with Botulinum toxin type A and serves as a control for the primary treatment group during the initial 6 weeks observation.\n\nBotulinum toxin A and placed will be injected near the neurovascular bundle at the A1 pulley in the palm of the hand using a total dosage 100 U per hand (concentration 50 U per ml), 8-12 U/ injection site.\n\nThe effect of Botulinum toxin type A on subjective symptoms will be measured by Patients Subjective Symptom Score (PSSS) The effect of Botulinum toxin type A on peripheral microcirculation will be evaluated with dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT) of the dorsal side of the hands. Quantitative sensory testing will be used to evaluate the effect of Botulinum toxin type A on peripheral nerve function. Both DIRT and QST will be performed prior to the treatment with Botulinum toxin type A and placebo at the start of the pilot study, at 6 weeks as well as 6 weeks after the last injections.\n\nStatistical methods and data analysis will be performed according to the EMA guidelines for biostatistics. Statistical analysis will be performed according to the null hypothesis.",

Long-term paraesthesia with occasional electric shock-type sensations have also been repored. The pathophysiology of these sequelae is still poorly understood although peripheral neurovascular dysfunction plays an important role. This may result in a vasospastic disorder similar as in Raynaud"s phenomenon.\n\nRecently, the use of Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for the treatment of vasospastic disorders of the hand has shown to result in great benefits for the patients by reducing the severity and number of vasospastic disorders. BTX-A injections are targeting the neurovascular bundle at or slightly proximal to the A1 pulley in the palm of the hand.\n\nA case history has described the off-label use of BTX-A to treat a Norwegian soldier who suffered from long-term sequelae of frostbite to his hands after a military exercise. He was successfully treated with BTX-A injections in each palm of the hand. At follow up, the patient reported less pain, warmer hands and improved sensory function. Dynamic Infrared thermography (DIRT) showed improved rewarming of all fingers compared to the pre-treatment examination, while Quantattive sensory testing (QST) showed a normalization of sensory function.\n\nAim of this pilot study To investigate the effect of Botulinum toxin type A for frostbite sequelae in fingers.\n\nHypothesis The null hypothesis is that all study-subjects will have equal distribution of symptoms and measurements after treatment, regardless of injection with Botulinum toxin type A or placebo.\n\nMethodology A two armed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design, performed at one single centre will be used. The study population consists of four soldiers with frostbite sequelae who will be recruited from the Norwegian Armed Forces Health Registry. These four soldiers are randomized to either treatment with Botulinum toxin type A or placebo according to computer-generated random numbers provided by the research unit at the University Hospital of North Norway. Two soldiers in the primary treatment group will receive Botulinum toxin type A at their first injection at inclusion, while the two soldires in the secondary treatment group will receive normal saline (placebo) as their first injection at inclusion. At 6 weeks follow up, the primary treatment group will receive their second injection of Botulinum toxin type A and the secondary treatment group now will receive their second injection, but this will be their first injection of Botulinum toxin type A.\n\nBy using the described study-design, all participating soldiers will get treatment. However, the secondary treatment group will have a delayed onset of treatment with Botulinum toxin type A and serves as a control for the primary treatment group during the initial 6 weeks observation.\n\nBotulinum toxin A and placed will be injected near the neurovascular bundle at the A1 pulley in the palm of the hand using a total dosage 100 U per hand (concentration 50 U per ml), 8-12 U/ injection site.\n\nThe effect of BTX- A on peripheral microcirculation will be evaluated with dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT) of the dorsal side of the hands. DIRT of the dorsal side of the hands encompass a pre-cooling phase (T1), a cooling phase of one minute (T2), and a four-minute recovery phase (T3, T4, T5 and T6). The pre-cooling phase include baseline measurements before the DIRT takes place and includes also the time from the initial image (T1) until the hands are immersed in water.\n\nThe DIRT procedure follows international standards and recommendations involving a cold challenge followed by a rewarming phase with both hands were positioned palms down on a grid made of thin nylon netting strung on a plastic frame. The nylon grid is positioned 7 cm (+/- 0.5 cm) above a uniformly heated base plate (40 +/-2°C) to ensure a thermally uniform background for the thermal imaging.\n\nQuantitative sensory testing will be used to evaluate the effect of BTX- A on peripheral nerve function. Thermal tests will be performed with a device TSA (Medoc, Israel) attaching a thermode to the investigated body part. Thermal tests include detection thresholds for warm and cold sensation, sensory limen (i.e., perception of changing temperatures, pain thresholds for heat and cold pain as well paradoxical cold or heat sensation. It is important to notice, that the maximum temperatures produced by the device are 0° or 50° for cold and warm, respectively. The test system automatically cancels the run, when the participant did not respond with pain up to these temperatures. Mechanical tests include also detection thresholds and pain thresholds. Mechanical detection is evaluated by von Frey hairs (pressure) and a standardized tuning fork (vibration). Pain thresholds are assessed by pin prick stimulation, pressure algometry. Additional tests for allodynia are included as well. Finally, there is a test to assess temporary summation using wind-up ratio to a repeated stimulation with pinprick (10 stimuli with 1/s).\n\nBoth DIRT and QST will be performed prior to the treatment with BTX- A and placebo at the start of the pilot study, at 6 weeks as well as 6 weeks after the last injections. At 6 months follow up after the first injection DIRT and QST will be repeated again.\n\nThe patient"s subjective symptoms are monitored by comparing Patient-Subjective-Symptom-Score (PSSS) after 6 weeks with the baseline values for each patient.\n\nStatistical methods and data analysis will be performed according to the EMA guidelines for biostatistics. Statistical analysis will be performed according to the null hypothesis."

It is responsible for over 1000 deaths a day, of which the majority are preventable (Levy, 2015).\n\nAsthma is a common heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of variable respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezes, and cough, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. Airflow limitation may later become persistent (GINA, 2023).\n\nThe diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of these characteristic symptoms and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests (GINA, 2023)."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the concept of a motion-triggered NMES training protocol through objective clinical outcome parameters and its impact on external rotational (ER) shoulder strength and throwing velocity in healthy, elite-level handball players.",

It is hypothesized that a 6-week motion-triggered NMES shoulder strengthening training protocol in elite-level handball players would lead to an increase in throwing velocity due to an improved motor ability and ER shoulder strength."

This study investigates whether virtual tour environments created using virtual reality glasses have an effect on patients&#39; vital signs, symptoms and comfort during the hemodialysis session. It is aimed to evaluate the effect of Virtual Reality Based Videos applied during hemodialysis treatment on Hemodialysis Symptoms, vital signs and Comfort.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Hemodialysis (HD) is one of the treatment options used to regulate renal functions in the treatment of chronic renal failure. In hemodialysis, patients have to cope with many problems during the treatment process as well as the disease. In addition, patients require HD treatment, which lasts three to four hours, three times a week on average. Factors such as having to go to a dialysis center for these treatments, patients having to continue their lives depending on the machine, restriction of movements during the session, increased dependency of the patient, deterioration in their adaptation to professional and social relationships affect the patients&#39; daily life activities and reduce their comfort. With the developing technology, virtual reality, a new technique in the healthcare industry, has begun to be used in nursing care in order to reduce the symptoms experienced by patients and to comfort the patient.\n\nThe virtual reality device removes the patient from the environment with the glasses and headphones attached to the person&#39;s head, along with the image on the screen and simultaneous sounds, and focuses his/her attention on the virtual video images. This study was planned as a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of virtual reality-based videos on hemodialysis symptoms and comfort in hemodialysis patients. The research was planned to be conducted with 50 hemodialysis patients. &#34;Patient Introduction Form&#34;, &#34;Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI)&#34;, &#34;Vital Signs Monitoring Form&#34;, &#34;Hemodialysis Comfort Scale Version II&#34; will be used to collect data. After the scales were applied, patients in the experimental group were exposed to virtual reality glasses for 30 minutes, twice a week for 8 weeks. The video will be watched. At the end of 8 weeks, the scales will be applied again and compared with the initial scale results.\n\nAs a result, in line with the findings obtained from the research, the effect of virtual reality application on dialysis symptoms, vital signs and comfort during hemodialysis treatment will be determined and suggestions will be made to encourage patients to use virtual reality methods in the environments where they are treated."

Genetic factors influence the development of obesity by affecting behavioral, dietary habits, and metabolic processes. This study investigated whether dietary supplements (DS), personalized through genetic and metabolic profiling, could enhance weight loss when combined with physical activity and dietary changes. The objective was to compare the efficacy of standard physician-guided DS prescriptions with AI-guided DS prescriptions in promoting weight loss in obese patients. The hypothesis was that AI-guided DS prescriptions, utilizing detailed genetic and metabolic data, would be more effective in promoting weight loss than standard physician-guided DS prescriptions. This was a 6-month randomized, controlled pilot clinical trial with an additional 6-month follow-up. Participants were healthy individuals aged 40-60 years with a BMI of 25 or greater. Participants were excluded if they had significant medical conditions or recent changes in medication or supplements. They were randomly assigned to either the control group (physician-guided DS prescriptions) or the AI-guided group (AI-determined DS prescriptions). The AI system developed by Triangel Scientific analyzed genetic, metabolic, and biochemical data to personalize treatment. Baseline measurements included comprehensive metabolic panels, genetic testing, metabolomic profiling, and detailed patient history"

              "BriefSummary": "Importance:\n\nPatient reported outcome and experience measures (PROM and PREM) constitute a cornerstone of the collective efforts to improve and personalize healthcare systems. The EORTC quality of life (QOL) group developed instruments evaluating general and disease specific oncology QOL questionnaires, and the quality of information received. Implementation of PREM and relevant PROM is essential for equity, better resources utility, accessibility and patient centered treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\nWe describe the EORTC INFO 25 translation process followed by investigation of subpopulation where action is most needed. We investigate which QOL questionnaire better reflects clinical parameters among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.\n\nDesign:\n\nA prospective cohort. Setting Tertiary, referral, head and neck dedicated surgical service.\n\nParticipants:\n\nConsecutive head and neck cancer adult patients, surgically treated, recruited between January to December 2022.\n\nExposures:\n\nWe prospectively analyzed the new EORTC INFO 25 Hebrew questionnaire together with previously established Arabic translated version and the general (QLQ-C30) and specific (QLQ - H&N43) oncology QOL questionnaires.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures:\n\nAnalyzing the quality of information provided and desired in diverse HNC subgroup of patients.\n\nAnalyzing which of PROM questionnaire better reflects HNC patients" disease and treatment parameters, which in turn, may predict poorer QOL.\n\nResults:\n\nWe recruited 60 patients, consisting of equal female: male ratio, of which 16.66% were native Arabic speaking. Validated INFO 25 scores (median 62.6±17.5) were not associated with patients" age, sex, education status, disease, and treatment parameters. Yet, the Arabic spoken sub-population had significantly lower scores (p<0.001).\n\nIn contrast to QLQ-C30, clinical imperative associations were demonstrated between QLQ - H&N43 and patients" disease stage (P<0.001), admission days (p<0.0001), free flap reconstruction (P<0.001) and adjuvant radiotherapy (P<0.001).\n\nConclusions and relevance:\n\nThe final version of the native EORTC INFO25 translation was approved by the EORTC. We demonstrate lower INFO25 scores among the Arabic speaking population, suggesting frail equity and accessibility. In order to improve patients" centered treatment and resource utilization, we reveal a strong association between disease severity and treatment aggressiveness and poor quality of life on specific, HNC oriented, EORTC QLQ - H&N43 questionnaire that was not validated on EORTC QLQ-C30, which can be omitted."

              "BriefSummary": "Shoulder impingement syndrome is primary cause of discomfort and restricted range of motion while reaching above in shoulder region. It is third most common illness affecting musculoskeletal system. The aim of this study will be to analyse comparative effects of active release technique and soft tissue mobilization on pain, range of motion and disability in shoulder impingement syndrome. The study will be a randomized clinical trial. A random sample of 40 subjects with shoulder impingement from Allied hospital, Faisalabad will be evaluated. Subjects who will meet selection criteria will be allocation into two groups by computerized generated allocation method. In addition to ultrasound as baseline treatment group a will receive active release technique while in group B soft tissue mobilization will be administrated for 4 weeks. Treatment session will be 12 session (3 sessions in one week). Baseline, at 2nd week and at 4th week of treatment pain, shoulder elevation, external rotation and shoulder disability will be measure by VAS, goniometer and SPADI. For, data analysis, we will use SPSS software version 23. Data was interrupted through independent t test and repeated measurements ANOVA.",
              "DetailedDescription": "STUDY DESIGN A Randomized Clinical Trial was conducted. SETTING The data of this study was collected from OPD of\n\nAllied Hospital Faisalabad\nDistrict Headquarter Hospital Faisalabad STUDY DURATION The investigation will be concluded within duration of 4 months subsequent to the acceptance of the synopsis.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION Individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. SAMPLING TECHNIQUE Random Sampling technique\n\nSAMPLE SIZE For size of sample calculation open epi-tool was used by taking overhead reach as main outcome measure (32), and the sample size calculated is 40. These 40 participants were then divided in 2 groups (Group A=20 and group 20). 6 patients will be drop out.\n\nINFORMED CONSENT A signed informed consent from was obtained from the participants before inclusion into the study as it was one of selection criteria. Before obtaining consent all patients in both groups were clearly informed about nature, objectives and duration of study and were assured that their data would not be used for any commercial purpose.\n\nENROLLENT Availability of signed consent from was considered as the criteria for enrollment to study.\n\nDATA COLLECTION TOOls Visual analogue scale The visual analogue scale will be used to evaluate the level of pain. VAS is dependable besides accurate self-assessment tool that comprises a 10 cm long horizontal line. The scores on this scale range from zero (indicating the absence of pain) to ten (representative the most severe pain possible). The participants were instructed to provide information on the highest level of discomfort they had encountered over the last twenty-four hours. A change of 1.5 points was deemed as the MCID for the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered survey considered to evaluate the level of pain besides functional impairment caused by shoulder disease. Assessment has a total of thirteen items, divided into two subscales: a pain subscale consisting of five items, and a disability subscale consisting of eight items. The SPADI values ranges from zero to hundred, through a higher number representative a higher level of impairment and disability. Persian iteration of the SPADI questionnaire was used as a dependable and accurate tool, and shown sensitivity to therapeutic modifications in individuals through shoulder ailments. The analysis included the SPADI-pain score, SPADI-disability score, and SPADI-total score. The SPADI total score has been reported to have a MCID ranging from 8 to 13.\n\nGoniometer ROM of the shoulder will be assessed by using a goniometer. The standardized goniometric measures demonstrated excellent consistency within the same rater. The upper limits for shoulder elevation as well as external rotation will be determined.\n\nThe patients will be instructed to do maximal range of motion exercises for all arm motions, disregarding any discomfort experienced. The participants will assume a supine position on an examination table during the whole range of movements. Their hips and knees were flexed at an angle of roughly 45°, ensuring that their feet remained level on the table to avoid any curvature of their backs. The elevation was achieved by fully extending the elbow and leading with the thumb. Rotation will be assessed when the shoulder was positioned at a 90° angle of abduction and the elbow was flexed at a 90° angle. Additionally, the forearm will maintain in a neutral position of supination.\n\nSCREENING TESTS Hawkins Kennedy test The Hawkins Kennedy exam will be administered to the patients. The patients will stand with their elbows bent to 90 degrees and their shoulders flexed to 90 degrees, the examiner performs, through passively applying an internally rotation force to arm. A positive result is obtained if the pain is experienced Neer test The sensitivity of this test is 72% and the specificity is 60%. In order to execute the maneuver, the therapist stabilizes the scapula, aligns the arm with the plane of the scapula, and then raises the arm without any active effort from the individual. A positive test result occurs when pain is triggered due to the impingement of the larger tuberosity on the acromion, specifically at an angle between 70 and 110 degrees.\n\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE Subject will screen on basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals who have positive screening test and sign consent form will be allocation in to two groups by computerized generated allocation method. Both Group A and B will be given US (Ultrasound) therapy to the subscapularis muscle insertion at the shoulder region, as a baseline treatment. The frequency used is 3 MHz, the intensity used was 0.5 watt/ Cmsq, and the time of the treatment of US was 10 minutes In addition to ultrasound as baseline treatment group a will receive active release technique while in group B soft tissue mobilisation will be administrated for 4 weeks. Treatment session will be 12 session (3 sessions in one week). Baseline, at 2nd week and at 4th week of treatment pain, shoulder elevation, external rotation and shoulder disability will be measure by VAS, goniometer and SPADI.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN Active release technique (ART) Group A will undergo active release therapy, which involves instructing the patient to sit and then positioning their shoulder in 90-degree abduction. The therapist will provide assistance to the patient"s arm and then examine the supraspinous fossa by applying pressure with a finger. The patient will be instructed to gradually bring the arm towards the body as the therapist manipulates the muscle plane. This procedure should be repeated for a duration of 10 minutes, 3 times per week, over a duration of four weeks.\n\nSoft tissue mobilization (STM) Group B will receive soft tissue mobilization (STM) targeting the subscapularis muscle. The participants will be placed in a position where their upper arm bone (humerus) is raised at a 45° angle, with the elbow bent at a 90° angle. Additionally, the humerus will be rotated outward to a position that is normally around 20° to 25° of external rotation. The subscapularis muscle remained examined by touch in the armpit area to locate regions of limited mobility due to myofascial limitations, trigger points or tense bands. The identified limitations remained addressed with STM, which included applying prolonged manual pressure and slow deep stroke to the subscapularis myofascial. This treatment was performed for a period of 7 minutes, three times a week, over a period of four weeks SCHEDULE FOR MEASURING OUTCOMES First at baseline then at 2nd week and at 4th week of treatment.\n\nFOLLOW-UPS AND TREATMENT SESSIONS:\n\nTotal 12 treatment sessions were done, 3 sessions in one week. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Using version 23 of SPSS, we will evaluate all of the data. The Shapiro-Wilk test and kurtosis, skewness will be used to evaluate the assumption of data normality. If the data is normally distributed, a parametric test will be used; otherwise, a nonparametric test will be used if the data does not meet the normality assumption.\n\nThe current study shows the effects of active release technique (ART) over soft tissue mobilization (STM).The aim of this study was to find out the effects of active realease technique, to find out the effects of soft tissue mobilization and to compare the effects of active release technique and soft tissue mobilization for the patients with shoulder impingment syndrome. This study was a randomized clinical trail (RCT) conducted on a sample convenient sample of 34 shoulder impingment syndrome patients reporting at Allied Hospital Faisalabad from Febuary, 2024 till April, 2024. This study was a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) included patients of shoulder impingment syndrome (SIS) selected on the basis on inclusion criteria, patient included into study after filling assessment form that was formed on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, consent was taken from patient and after assessment of patients were randomly allocated into two groups i.e. Group A (Active Release Technique) and Group B (Soft Tissue Moblization). Both groups were followed for the duration of one month, 12 treatment sessions was done. Data collected from the patients were, shoulder pain, ROM of shoulder elevation, external rotation and SPADI questionnaire. Treatment was done to check the effects of interventions for reduction pain and improvement of functional abilities and range of motion of patients of shoulder impingment syndrome, one questionnaire were used for evaluation of pain and functional activities, visual analogue scale for pain, gonimeter for ROM. Primary outcome i.e pain were taken 3 times i.e. at baseline, at 2nd week and after 4th week, while secondary outcome i.e. function and ROM were taken at baseline, at 2nd week and at 4th week. Both treatments are equally effective in decreasing pain and disability. The active release technique and soft tissue mobilization have previously been used for the cure of shoulder pain in clinical settings and in several research studies and always been considered as the best treatment protocol for shoulder pain."

Additionally, the humerus will be rotated outward to a position that is normally around 20° to 25° of external rotation. The subscapularis muscle remained examined by touch in the armpit area to locate regions of limited mobility due to myofascial limitations, trigger points or tense bands. The identified limitations remained addressed with STM, which included applying prolonged manual pressure and slow deep stroke to the subscapularis myofascial. This treatment was performed for a period of 7 minutes, three times a week, over a period of four weeks.",

              "BriefSummary": "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is currently the preferred treatment for upper urinary tract stones larger than 2cm. In the standard PCNL procedure, a nephrostomy tube and a ureteral stent are often placed before the end of surgery. Recently, PCNL without indwelling nephrostomy tube but with indwelling ureteral stent (also called "tubeless PCNL") or PCNL without indwelling nephrostomy tube and ureteral stent (also called "totally tubeless PCNL") has been put into practice. Compared with the standard PCNL , tubeless or totally tubeless PCNL can effectively reduce postoperative pain and shorten hospital stay, while the incidence of complications does not significantly increase.\n\nIs it possible not to leave a ureteral stent but leave a nephrostomy tube (also called "stent-less PCNL") after PCNL? In theory, the nephrostomy tube can have certain effect, such as decreasing the risk of post-operative bleeding. On the other hand, not indwelling a ureteral stent can bring benefits to patients. Recently, there is limited research on not indwelling ureteral stent after PCNL, and its safety and feasibility require clinical validation.\n\nIn summary, investigators conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to explore the safety and feasibility of not indwelling ureteral stent after PCNL.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is currently the preferred treatment for upper urinary tract stones larger than 2cm. In the standard PCNL procedure, a nephrostomy tube and a ureteral stent are often placed before the end of surgery to ensure urine drainage, promote fistula healing, and reduce the occurrence of kidney stones entering the ureter. With the improvement of surgical techniques, PCNL without indwelling nephrostomy tube but with indwelling ureteral stent (also called "tubeless PCNL") or PCNL without indwelling nephrostomy tube and ureteral stent (also called "totally tubeless PCNL") has been put into practice. Compared with the standard PCNL , tubeless or totally tubeless PCNL can effectively reduce postoperative pain and shorten hospital stay, while the incidence of complications does not significantly increase.\n\nIs it possible not to leave a ureteral stent but leave a nephrostomy tube (also called "stent-less PCNL") after PCNL? This clever method combined two advantages. In theory, the nephrostomy tube can have certain effect, such as decreasing the risk of post-operative bleeding, and avoiding the occurrence of emergency events related to ureteral stones. On the other hand, not indwelling a ureteral stent can bring benefits to patients. Recently, there is limited research on not indwelling ureteral stent after PCNL, and its safety and feasibility require clinical validation.\n\nOn the other hand, the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life (WISQOL), as a specific quality of life scoring system for stone patients, has been widely promoted and applied in many countries around the world. Investigators have recently translated this foreign version of the scoring system into Chinese in order to help serve patients with urinary tract stones in China.\n\nIn summary, investigators conducted a single center prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare and analyze the complications of not indwelling ureteral stent after PCNL, WISQOL questionnaire scores, and explore the safety and feasibility of not indwelling ureteral stent after PCNL."

              "BriefSummary": "This study investigates the efficacy of different anesthesia methods (general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway and local nebulized anesthesia) for transbronchial biopsy using an electronic bronchoscope. The study retrospectively analyzed cases of transbronchial biopsy performed at the Respiratory Endoscopy Center of Sichuan Provincial People"s Hospital from June 5, 2020, to June 5, 2024. Data collected included age, gender, primary diagnosis, anesthesia method, biopsy method, operation time (excluding general anesthesia and laryngeal mask airway placement time), lesion location and size, pathological results, and follow-up status.",
              "DetailedDescription": "General anesthesia and local anesthesia are the primary anesthesia methods for interventional respiratory endoscopy. While general anesthesia offers greater comfort, it carries anesthesia-related risks. Local anesthesia, on the other hand, provides a relatively low surgical risk and cost-effectiveness. However, there is limited research on whether its diagnostic value is inferior to that of general anesthesia.This study investigates the efficacy of the two anesthesia methods (general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway and local nebulized anesthesia) for transbronchial biopsy. The study retrospectively analyzed cases of transbronchial biopsy performed at the Respiratory Endoscopy Center of Sichuan Provincial People"s Hospital from June 5, 2020, to June 5, 2024. Data collected included age, gender, primary diagnosis, anesthesia method, biopsy method(forcep/cryobiopsy), operation time (excluding general anesthesia and laryngeal mask airway placement time), lesion location and size, pathological results, and follow-up status(pneumothorax、hemorrhage)."

              "BriefSummary": "At present, the evaluation of the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer is mainly based on postoperative pathology, among which, the pathological assessment of tumor regression grade (TRG) and TNM staging are the basis for the routine pathological diagnosis of esophageal cancer, and the College of American Pathologists divides the TRG after neoadjuvant therapy to esophageal cancer into four grades: 0, 1, 2, and 3.The residual primary tumor in the resection specimen following neoadjuvant therapy is associated with shorter overall survival. Therefore ，the prediction of TRG after neoadjuvant therapy is vital for patients. We aim to see to identify factors associated with TRG system as defined by the NCCN.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer globally (934,870 new cases) and the sixth most common cause of cancer death (287,270 new deaths).The incidence, prevalence, and histological type of oesophageal cancer vary geographically , with about 75% of cases occurring in Asia, with China having the highest share, accounting for about 50% of the total cases and cancer-specific deaths. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, Statistics 2022, there were 252,500 cases of oesophageal cancer and 193,900 deaths in China in 2016, making oesophageal cancer the sixth most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in China . The etiology of the two most common histological subtypes (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC] and adenocarcinoma) varies widely. In the West, heavy alcohol consumption and smoking and their synergistic effects are the main risk factors for ESCC . However, in low-income countries, such as parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the main risk factors for ESCC, which typically accounts for more than 90% of all oesophageal cancer cases, have not been elucidated.\n\nPreclinical studies have shown that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis can be activated early in solid tumours , and a durable protective effect may occur with preoperative induction of the immune response. Considering the dramatic decrease in tumour antigens after surgical resection and the removal of intact blood vessels and lymph nodes delivering the drug may affect the immunotherapeutic efficacy, the use of immunotherapy preoperatively may be more effective. Several phase 1/2 and phase 2 studies have shown a manageable safety profile and preliminary demonstration of efficacy when PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were added to perioperative therapy in resectable EC subjects. PD-1 inhibitors have demonstrated significant benefit in both second-line therapy and first-line therapy. Given the evidence of antitumour activity of immunotherapy in patients with ESCC and the continuing need to improve survival and reduce recurrence rates in resectable oesophageal cancer, a number of studies exploring the antitumour activity of immunotherapy in the treatment of resectable disease have tentatively shown promise as a neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nCurrently, after patients receive neoadjuvant therapy, tumour cell regression can occur with a variety of histological changes, such as tumour cell necrosis and apoptosis, fibrous tissue proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration, foam cell aggregation, cell-free mucus production and formation of mucus pools, as well as calcified foci formation. However, not all tumours produce the above regression reactions after treatment, fibrohistiocytosis and inflammatory cell infiltration are the most common histological regression changes, and in order to assess the clinical therapeutic efficacy of the tumour, tumour regression needs to be graded quantitatively.TRG is a quantitative analysis of the pathology of tumours resected after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy or targeted drugs on tumours and to predict the patient"s postoperative recurrence and metastasis. Metastasis. It was firstly used to assess the efficacy of oesophageal cancer after concurrent radiotherapy; and then gradually used to assess the efficacy of oesophageal cancer. The current assessment of post-radiotherapy samples is mainly based on the proportion of residual tumour components and fibrosis to grade pathological regression. Currently, the main methods for TRG scoring after neoadjuvant radiotherapy include NCCN, AJCC and other standards.\n\nCurrently, based on the data of pre-surgical clinical studies, the remission rate after neoadjuvant therapy varies in different oesophageal segments, which may indicate that the difference in blood supply of oesophageal cancer in different segments affects the blood drug concentration, leading to different clinical outcomes in patients with oesophageal cancer in different segments. In order to better treat patients in different segments, it is necessary to establish a prediction model based on the clinical data of patients in different oesophageal segments for better clinical decision-making."

              "DetailedDescription": "Few studies report the efficacy of telerehabilitation treatments in developmental age. The results suggest that it could be a promising tool for neurorehabilitation.The present pilot study aims at networking the experience gained in neurorehabilitation of developmental neurodisabilities from the 3 poles of IRCCS Medea (Brindisi, Bosisio Parini, and Conegliano) to evaluate the feasibility of performing home-based TR on cognitive and motor aspects through the Khymeia VRRS platform. VRRS represents an innovative system for immersive and non-immersive virtual reality rehabilitation and telerehabilitation.\n\nIn view of recent developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their applicability to the neurological evaluation and rehabilitation context, VRRS instrumentation may represent a suitable methodology to assess the feasibility of a rehabilitation and telerehabilitation protocol for patients with complex neurodisabilities in pediatric age.\n\nThe present pilot project involves the use of the VRRS technology platform and the use of exercises performed in a 3D virtual and non-3D virtual environment. Implementation in the virtual environment of the exercises allows the therapist to set up, graduate, and modulate the selected exercises in the platform. The playful aspects and continuous performance monitoring and evaluation are then a key aspect in the rehabilitation process, as they keep the patient"s motivation high. Through Home Tablets delivered to the patient, the platform makes possible home telerehabilitation through the proposal of cognitive and motor activities in 2 modes, Online (in the presence of the therapist) and Offline.\n\nIn order to test the feasibility of cognitive-motor rehabilitation intervention protocols carried out through VRRS, 30 patients (10 per research center) will be recruited and treated by using the VRRS library exercises. The VRRS exercises will be chosen according to the specific rehabilitation needs of each participant.\n\nThe study is designed as a two-year multicenter prospective clinical-experimental pilot study. The project involves the initial small-scale application of a telerehabilitation study protocol to test whether the methodology is appropriate, establish its feasibility, and derive useful information for sample size calculation for subsequent randomized trials. For prospective data collection, patients will be consecutively enrolled at participating centers.\n\nIf the VRRS is confirmed to be a suitable tool for conducting cognitive and motor TR in this clinical population as well, the present study may set the stage for future efficacy studies.\n\nOther objectives of the study are:\n\nto identify within the network telerehabilitation programs aimed at improving cognitive and motor functions in developmental-age individuals with neurodisabilities, identifying common modes of intervention;\nto collect a longitudinal data set through the use of specific assessment batteries on motor, cognitive and functional adaptation functions, including from the perspective of ICF, secondary complications, autonomy, participation and quality of life. As a pilot study, conduct initial analyses of the effectiveness of interventions in order to create useful data for sample size calculation for subsequent randomized trials;\nto provide health policy makers with better scientific evidence on telerehabilitation in order to plan interventions aimed at better utilization and enhancement of these methods;\nto highlight good practices related to telerehabilitation by proposing a series of evaluations and recommendations aimed at fostering further improvement in the quality of rehabilitation."

The AI system used genetic, metabolic, and clinical data to personalize DS regimens, hypothesizing superior efficacy over traditional methods. This 3-month randomized, controlled trial involved adults aged 40-75 with specific LDL-C levels, excluding those with significant health risks. Participants were divided into a control group with physician-guided DS and an AI-guided group. The AI system from Triangel Scientific provided dynamic, personalized recommendations. Baseline and follow-up measurements included lipid profiles and adherence assessments. The AI-guided group showed significantly greater LDL-C reduction and improvement in other lipid markers. The study concluded that AI-guided DS prescriptions are more effective, suggesting a promising future for AI in personalized cholesterol management."

Groups 3 (Grp.3): The patients received ALA-PDT at ten days intervals for 4 sessions combined with hydrogel dressing change every three days intervals. The wound healing rate, total effective rate, patient satisfaction, adverse reaction, and recurrence were assessed in all groups.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Randomly divide the enrolled patients into three groups for treatment by utilizing SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.). Initially, the wound pus and secretions were washed three times with a sterile saline solution. Subsequently, surgical instruments were employed to debride the wound, particularly the necrotic tissue, as well as any carrion and foreign bodies within the wound bed and cavity, with care being taken to avoid injury to nerves and blood vessels in the surrounding area. Grp.1 was covered with hydrogel dressing (PAUL HARTMANN AG, Germany) and replaced 2-3 times a week with topical mupirocin ointment three times a day. Grp.2 received photodynamic therapy only. Grp.3 accepted PDT, then coated with hydrogel dressing as mentioned above. The treatment protocol of PDT is described as follows: after thorough debridement, ALA (Shanghai Fudan-Zhang jiang Bio-Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, China) in an oil-in-water emulsion was smeared on the wound. After covering with dark plastic film for 3h, the wounds were illuminated by a light-emitting diode (LED) red light (Shenzhen Lifotronic Technology Co., Ltd, China). After the operation, a cold ice compress can be used to relieve the swelling and pain. Then, the hydrogel was uniformly applied to the wound and its surroundings (Grp.3). Grp.2 and Grp.3 received PDT at an interval of ten days for 4 sessions. In all groups, treatment responses and adverse reactions were recorded. All patients received the treatment as mentioned above and then evaluated the clinical outcome. After the end of the treatment, all patients returned for follow up at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12."

              "DetailedDescription": "Study Title Comparative Effectiveness of the ELDOA Method and Upper Thoracic Mobilization and Mobility Exercises in Correcting Forward Head Posture: A Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nIntroduction Forward Head Posture (FHP) is a common postural deformity characterized by an anterior positioning of the head relative to the vertical axis of the body. This condition can lead to various musculoskeletal issues, including neck pain, reduced range of motion, and increased disability. The Elongation Longitudinaux Avec Decoaptation Osteo Articulaire (ELDOA) method and upper thoracic mobilization and mobility exercises are two interventions aimed at correcting FHP. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of these two methods in reducing FHP and associated symptoms.\n\nObjectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the ELDOA method and upper thoracic mobilization and mobility exercises in reducing FHP. Secondary objectives include assessing improvements in pain levels, neck disability, and range of motion.\n\nStudy Design This study is a randomized clinical trial.\n\nParticipants A total of 36 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, each consisting of 18 participants.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n\nAdults aged 20-40 years\nDiagnosed with forward head posture\nAble to provide informed consent\nNo history of recent neck or upper thoracic surgery\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nSevere musculoskeletal or neurological disorders\nRecent injury to the neck or upper back\nPregnant or breastfeeding women\n\nInterventions Group A (ELDOA Method): Participants will undergo the ELDOA method, which involves specific postural exercises designed to create fascial tension and decompress the spine.\n\nGroup B (Upper Thoracic Mobilization and Mobility Exercises)**: Participants will receive upper thoracic mobilization techniques combined with mobility exercises aimed at improving posture and reducing FHP.\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nNumerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): To assess the intensity of pain experienced by participants.\nGoniometer: To measure the range of motion of the cervical spine.\nNeck Disability Index (NDI): To evaluate the level of disability associated with neck pain.\nWeb Plot Digitizer (WPD) Software : To analyze and quantify postural changes from photographic data.\n\nProcedure\n\nScreening and Baseline Assessment: Participants will be screened for eligibility and baseline measurements will be taken using NPRS, a goniometer, NDI, and WPD.\nRandomization: Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the ELDOA group or the upper thoracic mobilization and mobility exercises group.\nIntervention Period: Both groups will participate in their respective interventions over a period of 8 weeks, with sessions conducted twice a week.\nFollow-Up Assessments : Outcomes will be reassessed at the end of the intervention period and compared to baseline values.\n\nStatistical Analysis Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 27. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to compare pre- and post-intervention outcomes within groups. Independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests will be employed to compare outcomes between the two groups. A significance level of p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\nExpected Outcomes It is hypothesized that both interventions will result in significant improvements in FHP, pain reduction, and decreased neck disability. However, the study aims to determine if one method is superior in achieving these outcomes.\n\nEthical Considerations This study will adhere to ethical guidelines for clinical research. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and the study protocol will be reviewed and approved by an appropriate ethics committee.\n\nConclusion This randomized clinical trial will provide valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of the ELDOA method and upper thoracic mobilization and mobility exercises in correcting forward head posture. The findings could inform clinical practice and guide the development of targeted interventions for FHP."

              "DetailedDescription": "Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have a higher risk of both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding (MB). Specifically, a subsequent analysis of the Hokusai study showed that the excess in MB was confined to patients with gastrointestinal cancer. In the RIETE registry, patients with gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers experienced more bleeding outcomes while patients with brain or lung cancer experienced more thrombotic outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of the Caravaggio trial, major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with CRC was low and similar in both apixaban and LMWH groups. Patients with CRC are underrepresented in the major trials examining treatment of CAT with anticoagulant. Despite concerns that DOACs pose a significant bleeding risk in CRC patients, many patients with CRC are treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban in clinical practice. Balancing risks of thrombosis recurrence and bleeding can be challenging and requires a nuanced, individualized approach to decision making to improve prognosis in this population. The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for recurrence and bleeding in CRC patients with VTE. Deaths, regardless of the mechanism, will also be included in the one year all-cause mortality outcome."

Both symptomatic individuals, diagnosed through symptom-prompted diagnostic imaging, and asymptomatic individuals, identified via imaging studies conducted for other medical purposes (e.g., cancer restaging), were included. VTE was considered cancer-related if the patient had a diagnosis of CRC within six months before or after the VTE diagnosis, any cancer treatment within the previous six months, or recurrent/metastatic cancer regardless of treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipation in this study required active anticoagulant treatment.

After extraction, alveolitis was observed and evaluated prospectively using spongostan, chlorhexidine gel and tranexamic acid in the dental sockets. The researcher checked the participants on the 3rd and 7th days after the tooth extraction. The researcher recorded the pain and edema levels by asking the participants between 0 and 10 using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The researcher filled in the forms for the presence of halitosis, trismus and exposed bone socket on the 3rd and 7th days (YES-NO). Permanent analyzes of the study were created with the SPSS package program."

              "DetailedDescription": "Although the calvarial bones represent a nearby donor site for maxillary augmentation of matching bone origin, the excessive volume of bone needed to reconstruct a severely deficient arch, the limited cancellous bone volume, and the arciform pattern of the skull cap that yield the curvatures of the harvested cortical blocks incompatible with the topography of the maxillary arch, all represent limitations for the calvarial graft.\n\nThe anterior iliac crest is frequently used for free bone grafting by being subcutaneous and generous to afford ample bone blocks of favorable curvatures. However, the minute cortical overlay and its endochondral origin contribute to excessive graft resorption. Pikos et al. demonstrated that a reasonable amount of graft resorption could occur with atraumatic surgical intervention and intimate graft fixation.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate and compare the quantity of the radiographic horizontal bone gain of severely deficient complete maxillary ridges reconstructed by bone block harvest from the iliac crest versus the calvarial bones."

Therefore, we are conducting this prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the postoperative analgesic effects of LB and ropivacaine for TAP blocks among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal procedures.",
              "DetailedDescription": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) on postoperative opioid usage for ultrasound(US)-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks in laparoscopic colorectal resections. We divided 76 patients into two groups. An injection of bilateral TAP blocks was administered to LB group using 133mg liposomal bupivacaine in each block (266mg total), and to R group using 20 ml 0.25% ropivacaine in each block (40 ml total). Opioid consumption and pain scores at 6h, 24h, 48h and 72h were recorded postoperatively, as well as the total intraoperative remifentanil dose, the hospital stay lengths after surgery, and adverse events including dizziness, nausea, and vomiting."

Although idiopathic scoliosis is more common during adolescence, its cause is not yet known. It is divided into three subheadings according to the age of onset. These are respectively; It is classified as Juvenile Idiopathic Scoliosis (0-3 years), Infantile Idiopathic Scoliosis (4-10 years), Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (10 years and above). The most common one is Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis. Its incidence in girls is 4 times higher than in boys. This study aimed to examine the effects of body image and self-esteem on quality of life in idiopathic adolescent scoliosis patients and to determine whether there is a difference between genders. Additionally, it will be examined what effect the duration of corset use has on these parameters.",

              "BriefSummary": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of therapeutic touch on patients" anxiety, vital signs and comfort levels during knee replacement surgery performed under local anesthesia.\n\nThe study will be completed with a total of 128 participants, including 64 experimental and 64 control participants.\n\nAs a randomization method, the simple randomization method will be used to ensure an equal number of samples in two groups, and patients will be assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the research, patients will be given verbal information about the research, and written informed consent will be obtained from the patients who accept it.\n\nIn the study, therapeutic touch was applied for 15-20 minutes during knee replacement surgery and the effect of this application on vital signs, anxiety level and comfort was evaluated.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Knee replacement surgeries are a common treatment method for patients with problems such as pain and limitation of movement resulting from knee joint disorders. This type of surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia, allowing patients to lose consciousness during surgery. However, general anesthesia may have some risks and complications. For this reason, local anesthesia has become increasingly popular.\n\nLocal anesthesia is a method of anesthesia used to numb the surgical area. In this method, anesthesia is injected directly into the surgical area and the patient is awake and conscious throughout the surgery. Local anesthesia may have fewer side effects and complications compared to general anesthesia. However, the effects of emotional factors such as stress, anxiety and discomfort experienced by patients during surgeries performed under local anesthesia are still poorly understood .\n\nThe human body is surrounded by an aura and open energy fields. It is reported that when these energy fields are balanced, the individual is healthy, and when they are irregular, the individual experiences health problems. Asymmetric energy fields can be balanced using the therapeutic touch method and treatment becomes easier. In this way, the person regains his health or can be helped to regain his health. Nursing theorist Martha Rogers supports this statement. Rogers defined human beings as an open system with a complex and interactive energy field covering the entire universe. It is assumed that the energy surrounding humans is in wave form and that changes in the human body are controlled by these energy fluctuations. If the person has health problems, this manifests itself in the form of energy blockages or rhythm disorders. By correcting these energy rhythm disorders discovered by the nurse with the therapeutic touch method, the person\"s health problem can be treated. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that alternative approaches, such as therapeutic touch, have positive effects on surgical outcomes. Therapeutic touch is a method that aims to provide relaxation, calming and healing through physical contact. This method can reduce patients\" stress levels, relieve pain, and increase their overall comfort level. However, there are limited studies on the effect of therapeutic touch on vital signs during knee replacement surgery performed under local anesthesia.\n\nSurgeries are widely used as a method of treating various health problems that require medical treatment. Knee prosthesis surgeries are one of the frequently used surgical interventions in the treatment of painful and limiting diseases of the knee joint. Although such surgeries have the potential to significantly improve individuals\" mobility and quality of life, the stress, anxiety and physical discomfort that may occur during and after the surgery can be a significant source of concern for patients.\n\nAnxiety is a common psychological reaction before and after surgical interventions and is an important factor affecting the surgical process. Patients may experience increased levels of anxiety when faced with uncertainty about the results of surgery, possible complications, and the recovery process. The importance of this situation is of great importance in terms of the success of the surgery and the patients\" ability to better manage the postoperative period.\n\nAnxiety negatively affects the patient\"s comfort level after surgery and can prolong the recovery process. Lack of comfort can lead to increased physical and emotional stress caused by surgery. It is important to note that because therapeutic touch has the potential to increase patients\" relaxation, stress reduction, and overall comfort level, research has also been conducted in this area. However, there is no definitive information about the effect of therapeutic touch on the comfort level during knee replacement surgery performed under local anesthesia.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of therapeutic touch on patients\" vital signs, anxiety and comfort level during knee replacement surgery performed under local anesthesia. This study aims to offer an alternative approach to improve patients\" quality of life by continuing to improve the results of surgeries performed under local anesthesia. This study aims to fill the gap in this field by investigating the effect of therapeutic touch on vital signs, anxiety and comfort level during knee replacement surgery performed under local anesthesia. The findings may guide clinical practice in providing an alternative approach to improve surgical outcomes and reduce discomfort experienced by patients. It may also provide basic information to evaluate the feasibility of therapeutic touch in other surgical procedures under local anesthesia.\n\nThis study was conducted as an experimental randomized controlled study. This method was preferred because it allows the situations and attitudes of the individuals in the group selected as a sample, regarding a phenomenon or event, and to describe the phenomena and events in their own conditions and as they are. In addition, in randomized controlled studies, the factors that cause events and situations and the degree of influence of these factors can be determined. In the study, therapeutic touch was applied for 15-20 minutes during knee replacement surgery and the effect of this application on vital signs, anxiety level and comfort was evaluated. The hypotheses created in the research are listed below; The research was conducted in the orthopedics and traumatology room in the operating room department of Atatürk University Training and Research Hospital between September 2023 and June 2024.\n\nThe population of the research consists of patients who had knee replacement surgery between September 2023 and February 2024. The sample of the research consists of patients who meet the inclusion criteria between the specified dates. Cohen\"s standard effect sizes were used as reference in the power analysis. In this case, in this study, for the t test in independent groups where the effect of therapeutic touch during knee prosthesis surgery will be compared on vital signs, anxiety and comfort levels, if the study is conducted with a total of 128 participants in two groups with 64 participants in each group, 80% confidence interval is 95% at a significance level of 0.05. It has been determined that power can be achieved. As a randomization method, the "simple randomization method" was used to ensure an equal number of samples in two groups, and the patients were assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the study, patients were given verbal information about the research, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients who agreed.\n\nFour different forms were used to collect data in the study. The Anxiety and Comfort Scale, which was determined as the data collection tool in the study, was chosen by the researcher as it was deemed suitable for the purpose. Analyzes were carried out with the data obtained to test the validity and reliability of the selected scale. In order to ensure that the data collection tools do not pose an ethical problem, people with expertise on the subject were consulted and it was ensured that they would not cause any problems. However, the scale questions were reviewed in detail by the researcher and the consultant, and since an application was actually made in the form of a Likert scale, leaving the selection decision entirely to the participants refutes the idea that it is a manipulation. The forms used to collect data are listed below;\n\nPatient Introduction Form\nVital Signs Record Form\nSpielberg State-Trait Anxiety Scale\nPerianesthesia Comfort Scale (PCS) In order to conduct the research, firstly, approval was obtained from the Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee and institutional permission was obtained from the hospital where the research was conducted. Verbal consent was obtained from the patients before data collection, and data collection forms were collected by the researcher in the orthopedics and traumatology room in the operating room department by face-to-face interview. Patients who accepted the study and met the criteria were included in the experimental/control group by randomization.\n\nIn patients included in the experimental group; On the day of surgery, patients who met the research criteria were met, the purpose of the study was explained, and their written consent was obtained. The Patient Introduction Form and the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Scale were administered in the patient room using face-to-face interview technique. When the patient was taken to the operating table, the Vital Signs Record Form was filled out. Then, therapeutic touch was applied for 15-20 minutes during the surgery. After the procedure was completed, the Vital Signs Record Form, Spielberg State Anxiety Scale and Perianesthesia Comfort Scale (PCS) were administered.\n\nIn patients included in the control group; On the day of surgery, patients who met the research criteria were met, the purpose of the study was explained, and their written consent was obtained. The Patient Introduction Form and the Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Scale were administered in the patient room using face-to-face interview technique. When the patient was taken to the operating table, the Vital Signs Record Form was filled out. After the procedure is completed, the Vital Signs Record Form, Spielberg State Anxiety Scale and Perianesthesia Comfort Scale (PCS) will be administered. No procedure was applied to the control group."

              "BriefSummary": "Feedback is implanted into workouts to prevent lower extremity injuries. There are different studies where external focus and internal focus feedback were found to be superior. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of training on vertical jump landing technique by comparing a verbal training group that receives instructions with an external focus of attention and an internal focus of attention combined, a visual training group with video instructions, and a control group in female athletes with knee valgus. It is also to examine whether possible beneficial results are still present in the retention test performed one week after the test session. The secondary aim of our study is to examine the effect of the training provided on knee joint position sense.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Approximately 70% of lower extremity injuries occur during non-contact, single-leg landings, and jumping to the ground is a common injury mechanism in both genders. Additionally, female athletes have higher injury rates compared to men, potentially due to anatomical differences of the lower kinematic chain. Events in which athletes experience non-contact ACL injuries generally show many common biomechanical features such as increased ground reaction forces during single-leg landing, decreased joint flexion in the sagittal plane of the ankle, knee, hip and trunk, as well as increased knee internal rotation angles. Another critical ACL injury risk factor is performing a secondary task during sharp deceleration movements. Current rehabilitation programs focus on neuromuscular training programs to prevent adverse movement patterns and increase proper movement control. However, there is still a need to increase the effectiveness of these neuromuscular training programs to have a more significant impact on ACL injury rates. Therefore, the use of motor learning strategies and neuromuscular training programs with adequate and correct techniques in the rehabilitation of athletes should still be investigated.\n\nThere are various approaches to motor learning. One of the best-known approaches is the cognitive approach, where the athlete reaches the automation stage by receiving feedback and repeating the model technique as often as possible. The common denominator of motor learning strategies is the use of explicit instructions and feedback regarding desired landing positions. Instructions for the implementation of movements in rehabilitation programs aim to improve performance and motor learning. These instructions may address the action outcome or the course of action. There are many studies showing that feedback training changes jump landing biomechanics. In line with the results of these studies, using feedback techniques, especially to reduce the vertical ground reaction force and increase the knee flexion angle during landing from a jump, can reduce the stress and risk of injury in the lower extremity.\n\nMotor skills can be learned with an internal focus of attention or with an external focus of attention. Although the difference in these instructions may seem insignificant, externally focused education; has been shown to result in better performance, retention, transfer, and greater movement automaticity. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of training on vertical jump landing technique by comparing a verbal training group that receives instructions with an external focus of attention and an internal focus of attention combined, a visual training group with video instructions, and a control group in female athletes with knee valgus. It is also to examine whether possible beneficial results are still present in the retention test performed one week after the test session. The secondary aim of our study is to examine the effect of the training provided on knee joint position sense."

              "BriefSummary": "Background: Diabetes is a growing public health concern in Bangladesh, with millions affected. Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is a severe complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 21.3% of the diabetic population. To address this issue, a comprehensive assessment of DKD within the Bangladesh Diabetic Association&#39;s (BADAS) affiliated healthcare centres is necessary.\n\nObjective: The study&#39;s general objective is to determine the prevalence of DKD and evaluate its management at BADAS-affiliated healthcare centers. Specific objectives include assessing risk factors, screening practices, disease staging, management approaches, patient education, and providing evidence-based recommendations.\n\nMethodology:\n\nStudy Design: Cross-sectional\nStudy Population: All diabetic patients at BADAS-affiliated centers\nExclusion Criteria: Patients unwilling to participate or with kidney disease from other causes and with acute illness\nSample Size: &#34;Forty patients will be selected from each center, resulting in a total sample size of 320 patients across eight centers, with one center randomly selected from each of the eight divisions in Bangladesh.&#34;\nData Collection: Demographics, comorbidities, kidney function, blood pressure, HbA1c levels, medication records, treatment guideline adherence\nData Analysis: prevalence of diabetic kidney disease, factors affecting management, and potential barriers\nEthical Considerations: Ensure patient data privacy, obtain approvals, and informed consent Implications: The study aims to provide insights into the current state of magnitude (prevalence) of DKD, its management, highlighting areas for improvement in patient care, guideline adherence, and ultimately enhancing the well-being of diabetic patients in Bangladesh.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Background: Diabetes mellitus represents a significant public health challenge globally, and Bangladesh is no exception to this growing epidemic. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), about 13.1 million people in Bangladesh have diabetes, and this number is expected to increase to 22.3 million by 2045(Sun et al., 2022). One of the most serious complications of diabetes is Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). DKD not only imposes a heavy burden on the healthcare system but also affects the economic and social well-being of the patients and their families. The prevalence of kidney disease among the diabetic population of Bangladesh is estimated to be around 21.3%. This number is based on a single center study conducted at the Bangladesh Institute of Health Sciences (BIHS) hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh(Islam et al., 2021). This high prevalence highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation of DKD within the centers affiliated with the Bangladesh diabetic association (BADAS), which is the largest non-governmental organization providing diabetes care and research in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Diabetic Association (BADAS), with its extensive network of diabetes care centers and healthcare professionals, has long been at the forefront of addressing diabetes-related health concerns in the country. As a nation-wide institution dedicated to diabetes care, BADAS plays a pivotal role in delivering healthcare services and shaping the well-being of diabetic patients in Bangladesh.\n\nA comprehensive understanding of DKD prevalence and management status within BADAS centers is essential to enhance the quality of care for diabetic patients. Identifying areas for improvement is the first step towards effecting positive change.\n\nOur ultimate plan is to implement a nationwide DKD prevention program through affiliated diabetic centers. To achieve this, a comprehensive assessment of the current situation is an imperative foundation for program design, planning, and execution.\n\nThe study will provide a rich dataset upon which evidence-based recommendations for preventing and managing DKD within BADAS-affiliated centers can be developed. These recommendations are essential for improving patient outcomes and ensuring the success of the future prevention program.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed study is a crucial undertaking aimed at addressing the pressing issue of DKD within the context of BADAS-affiliated healthcare centers. It serves as the first step towards the larger goal of implementing a nationwide DKD prevention program, with the potential to positively impact the health and well-being of diabetic patients across Bangladesh.\n\nObjective:\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\nTo determine the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease and assess the management status of diabetic kidney disease in patients attending affiliated healthcare centers of the Bangladesh Diabetic Associations.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nDetermine the Prevalence of Diabetic Kidney Disease: Calculate the prevalence of DKD among diabetic patients visiting BADAS-affiliated healthcare centers using clinical and laboratory assessments.\n\nAssess Risk Factors for DKD: Identify and analyze demographic and clinical factors associated with the development of DKD in the study population.\n\nEvaluate Screening Practices: Evaluate the extent to which BADAS-affiliated healthcare centers conduct regular screening of registered diabetic patients for DKD and assess the effectiveness of current screening protocols.\n\nCharacterize Disease Staging: Determine the stages of DKD among patients diagnosed with the condition and assess the proportion of patients with various stages of renal impairment.\n\nAnalyze Management Approaches: Investigate the treatment modalities, including pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications, and patient education, used to manage DKD in the healthcare centers.\n\nAssess Healthcare Professional Awareness: Evaluate the awareness and knowledge of healthcare professionals working in BADAS-affiliated centres regarding DKD prevention, diagnosis, and management.\n\nAssess the infrastructural support of BADAS-affiliated centres regarding DKD prevention, diagnosis, and management.\n\nExamine Patient Education and Engagement: Assess the level of patient education and engagement in DKD management programs, including lifestyle modification guidance and adherence to treatment plans.\n\nProvide Recommendations: Based on the study findings, generate evidence-based recommendations for improving the prevention, early detection, and management of DKD in BADAS-affiliated healthcare centers to enhance the quality of care for diabetic patients.\n\nMaterial and Methodology:\n\nStudy Design:\n\nCross-sectional study design.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nAll registered diabetic patients receiving care at affiliated healthcare centres of Bangladesh Diabetic Associations.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nUnwilling to participate in the study. Presence of AKI or acute illness Presence of Known kidney disease due to other cause.\n\nSampling method: Multi-stage sampling.\n\nSample size calculation:\n\nThe formula to calculate the sample size:\n\nWhere:\n\nn = required sample size Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level) p = expected prevalence (in decimal form) E = margin of error (in decimal form) Expected prevalence of DKD to be 21.3% (0.213 in decimal form) Confidence level 95% Margin of error of 5% (0.05 in decimal form)\n\nUsing these values, the sample size calculation would look like this:\n\n= 292 However, we will select forty patients from each centre, resulting in a total sample size of 320 patients across eight centres, with one centre will be randomly selected from each of the eight divisions in Bangladesh.\n\nData Collection:\n\nGather patient data, including demographics, comorbidities, kidney function (eGFR, UACR), blood pressure measurements, and HbA1c levels.\n\nReview medication records to determine the use of anti-proteinuric medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, SGLT2i, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoids receptor antagonists and GLP analogues).\n\nAssess adherence to recommended treatment guidelines for diabetic kidney disease management.\n\nCollect data on healthcare professionals&#39; awareness and knowledge of DKD prevention, diagnosis, and management.\n\nGather data on the infrastructure available in BADAS-affiliated centres for DKD prevention, diagnosis, and management.\n\nScreening for the presence of DKD\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for diabetic kidney disease (DKD)(McGrath and Edi, 2019, ElSayed et al., 2022):\n\nDKD is usually a clinical diagnosis in a patient with long-standing diabetes (&gt;10 years) with albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage.\n\nAlbuminuria: Increased urinary albumin excretion is defined as ≥30 mg/g. (2 out of 3 in 3 to 6 months).\n\nReduced estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR): &lt;60ml/minute/1.73m2. for more than 3 months Duration of Diabetes: DKD is typically associated with a long duration of diabetes (&gt;10 years" duration of type 1 diabetes; may be present at diagnosis in type 2 diabetes).\n\nPresence of Retinopathy: DKD is typically associated with retinopathy however the absence of retinopathy does not exclude DKD in type 2 diabetes.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nEvaluate the proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure control (e.g., &lt;130/80 mm Hg), glycaemic control (e.g., HbA1c &lt;7%), and receiving appropriate anti-proteinuric medications.\n\nExamine factors associated with successful management, including age, gender, duration of diabetes, and comorbidities.\n\nIdentify potential barriers to achieving optimal management.\n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nEnsure patient data privacy and confidentiality. Obtain necessary approvals and informed consent for data access and analysis.\n\nImplications:\n\nProvide insights into the current magnitude and state of diabetic kidney disease management, specifically focusing on blood pressure and glycaemic control and the utilization of anti-proteinuric medications among diabetic patients.\n\nHighlight areas for improvement in patient care and guideline adherence to enhance diabetic kidney disease management."

In our study, it will be revealed which technique will have what effect in the strengthening, which will be done by taking certain criteria into consideration. Participants will be randomized into three different groups. Two groups, except the control group, will exercise three times a week for 6 weeks. All participants will be assessment twice in total, at the beginning of the study and 6 weeks later. It is thought that the results obtained here will contribute to the literature.",
              "DetailedDescription": "The study was planned to include individuals studying at Halic University, who met the inclusion criteria and volunteered to participate in the study. Evaluated participants will be randomly assigned to three different groups (control group, video-based game exercise group, real game-free exercise group). The sealed envelope method will be used in randomization. All evaluations by the same physiotherapist will be performed twice, before exercise and after 6 weeks of exercise. Both exercise groups will practice under the supervision of a physiotherapist. The control group will not exercise and will only be evaluated twice. At the end of the study, those in the control group will be able to participate in any exercise group they want for 6 weeks."

              "BriefSummary": "The effect of muscular strength deficits on postural control after Lisfranc injury has been explained in relation to stance duration and strength. However, the relationship between protective sole sensation and changes in ankle proprioception, balance, ankle mobility and Achilles tendon structural properties has been shown in previous studies. The aim of our study was to determine the possible changes in protective sole sensation, ankle proprioception, balance and functional capacity after Lisfranc injury and to analyse the relationship between these variables.",
              "DetailedDescription": ""Lisfranc injury" refers to an injury in which one or more metatarsals are displaced. Lisfranc injury covers a wide network of injuries. It includes various types, including a low-energy sports injury or a high-energy lesion, as well as a purely connective tissue injury. 20% of Lisfranc injuries are undiagnosed or diagnosed late. Early and accurate diagnosis of injuries is a basic requirement for appropriate treatment and prevention of secondary problems that may arise in the long term . Fracture-dislocation in the tarsometatarsal junction of the foot is treated with anatomical reduction, internal fixation or primary arthrodesis. However, many individuals have poor functional outcomes . Anatomical repositioning and excellent postoperative radiographic findings may not result in high patient satisfaction. As a result, no matter what type of treatment is used after Lisfranc injury, it should be supported by a good rehabilitation protocol. As a result of our research in the literature, the investigators encountered studies that performed gait analysis, muscle strength and plantar pressure measurements after Lisfranc injury. However, no study has been encountered examining parameters such as sole sense, proprioception, and balance after injury of the foot, which is the only limb in contact with the ground. After determining these values, revising the rehabilitation protocols specifically for the evaluation parameters will reduce the morbidity rate after injury and accelerate functional recovery.\n\nRehabilitation protocols that emphasize the use of exercises to improve joint range of motion, muscle strength, neuromuscular coordination, and gait mechanics after foot and ankle injuries have been found to improve function . There is also evidence that the plantar flexor muscles of these patients are weakened after injury. There are also groups of patients who complain of instability when walking barefoot or on uneven ground after foot or ankle injuries. In a different study examining the dynamic plantar pressure distribution, force capacity and postural control change after Lisfranc injury, it was found that atrophy occurred after long-term immobilization in both the injured extremity and the contralateral extremity.\n\nAltered postural control after injury was manifested by a significant decrease in unilateral stance time. Adequate rehabilitation following anatomical open reduction after Lisfranc injury is very important for clinical outcome. A detailed evaluation is required to determine adequate rehabilitation. Considering these studies, evaluating balance will be important for patients with Lisfranc injuries.In our study, the investigators aim to provide information about postural control change after injury by evaluating dynamic balance with the Modified star excursion test. In this way, the intensity of balance exercises can be adjusted while shaping the post-injury rehabilitation program. Evaluated gait analysis and functional results in patients following a designated rehabilitation program after Lisfranc injury. In this study evaluating patients with lisfranc injury treated with 3 different methods (conservative, open reduction internal fixation and primary arthrodesis), significantly reduced joint range of motion, lower walking speed and significantly lower flexion/extension of the midfoot compared to healthy subjects during the pushing phase. These changes may result from loss of muscle strength, differences in surgical methods or different rehabilitation protocols. This change during the pushing phase and the decrease in walking speed negatively affect the lives of patients functionally.\n\nDetermination of ankle mobility after injury, determination of rehabilitation effectiveness and functional evaluation will be used for the first time in our study for patients with lisfranc injury. In addition to this information, in our study, the investigators aim to evaluate functional capacity with AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) Midfoot Score , FAOS(Foot and Ankle Outcome Score) and heel-rise tests and be the first study in the literature to apply this test on ligamentous injury. The data obtained after the evaluation may increase the clinical use of these easy and inexpensive tests. Thus, function after Lisfranc injury can be evaluated much more easily, quickly and objectively. Lisfranc injury does not only cause deficits in muscle strength and joint range of motion. Many factors, such as long-term immobilization after injury, damage to structures rich in mechanoreceptors, or surgery, can lead to changes in both sole sensation and joint position sense."

              "BriefSummary": "This study aims to investigate the analgesic efficacy of Intermediate Cervical Plexus Block combined with GA using two bupivacaine concentrations in patients undergoing neck surgeries (total thyroidectomy or total laryngectomy)",
              "DetailedDescription": "This randomized comparative study was conducted in Cairo University hospitals after the approval of the institutional research and ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Guidelines were followed.\n\nThe patients were randomly allocated into two groups (H & L) using computer generated random numbers that were concealed in opaque envelopes. Group H received 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine and Group L received 20 ml 0.125% bupivacaine bilaterally.\n\nOn arrival to the operating room, an 18G cannula was inserted with the infusion of 500 ml Ringer solution. Controloc 40 mg, ondansetron 8 mg, and dexamethasone 8 mg were administered as premedication. The diaphragmatic motion was assessed by a 3.5 MHz curvilinear transducer, siemens ACUSON X300 ultrasound. Each hemidiaphragm was first visualized by B-mode then M-mode was used to evaluate diaphragmatic excursion. For the right hemidiaphragm, the transducer was placed perpendicularly over the right subcostal margin in the anterior axillary line, the prob was then directed cephalad and dorsally to reach the posterior one-third of the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic excursions were measured and recorded in millimeters using the liver as an acoustic window during quiet breathing. The left hemidiaphragm was assessed in the same way using the spleen as an acoustic window.\nAll patients connected to an electrocardiograph (ECG), pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and baseline values of HR and MAP were measured and recorded. Additional monitoring in the form of a capnogram, invasive blood pressure (IBP) through a radial artery cannula, peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS), Bispectral index (BIS), and urine output were connected after induction of GA. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous fentanyl 2µg/kg, propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg. When the TOF count showed the disappearance of T1 (0/4), an appropriate-size endotracheal tube was inserted and secured. Under complete aseptic conditions, ultrasound guided bilateral ICPB was performed by a single staff anesthetist who is skilled in carrying out regional anesthesia.\nICPB technique: The patient\"s head was rested on a pillow and turned to the opposite side. A linear probe with higher frequencies was placed transversely over the midpoint of the SCM muscle. The carotid artery was identified and traced upwards to its bifurcation. the probe was then moved laterally to identify the tapering posterolateral end of the SCM muscle. Via an in-plane technique, a 22-gauge, 50 mm needle was advanced underneath the investing fascia of SCM muscle and above the interscalene groove until the "pop" on piercing the investing fascia was felt. The patient was then randomly allocated into two groups (H & L) using computer generated random numbers that were concealed in opaque envelopes. Group H received 20 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine and Group L received 20 ml 0.125% bupivacaine. The technique was repeated on the opposite side.\nDuring the intraoperative period, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1.2-1.5 vol% to keep BIS value at 40-60 and atracurium 0.1mg/kg guided by PNS. Additional doses of fentanyl 0.05 µg/kg were administered when HR or MAP increased > 20% of the baseline values. MAP and HR were measured after the skin incision, and then every 30 minutes till the end of surgery. The failed block was considered when ≥ four additional doses of fentanyl were required to manage the increased MAP or HR after skin incision. At the end of the surgery, one gram of paracetamol plus 30 mg of ketorolac were administered.\nDuring the postoperative period, regular analgesia in the form of intravenous paracetamol one gram/8hr was prescribed. Pain severity was assessed by using the visual analog scale (VAS) (0= no pain and 100mm= worst pain) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hr postoperatively. Rescue analgesia in the form of intravenous morphine 0.05 mg/kg was given on the patient\"s complaint or when VAS ≥ 40 mm and repeated every 15-20 minutes until VAS < 40 mm with a maximum morphine dose of 40 mg per 24 hours. The duration of analgesia was calculated as the time elapsed from the end of the ICPB block procedure till VAS ≥ 40mm. The total postoperative morphine consumption over 24 hours was calculated. The measurement of diaphragmatic excursions was repeated as mentioned above, hemi-diaphragmatic paresis was divided into three grades, depending on the percentage of diaphragm movement compared with baseline to be: none (> 75%), partial paresis (25-75%), and complete paresis (< 25%)"

              "BriefSummary": "The Internet shows its presence in areas where human beings are actively involved, from education to health, from entertainment to the investment sector. The integration of the Internet into many areas of human life leads to its intensive use. According to the Global Digital Report, the number of individuals with access to the Internet worldwide at the beginning of 2024 is stated as 5.35 billion, and this number constitutes more than 66% of the total world population. One of the pioneering studies on internet addiction was conducted by Young. In this study, five subtypes of internet addiction were identified. These are cyber sex addiction (obsessive use of adult sites such as cyber sex, cyber porn), cyber relationship addiction (excessive involvement in online relationships), net compulsions (online gambling, shopping and trading), information overload (on websites). and constantly surfing databases) and computer addiction (playing computer games). Considering the sub-dimensions of internet addiction, it is seen that it affects many areas of life, from family life to interpersonal relationships, from social life to economic life. Conscious awareness is the awareness of one"s internal state and environment. Mindfulness can help people avoid destructive or automatic habits and reactions by learning to observe their thoughts, feelings, and other momentary experiences without judging or reacting. Acting based on awareness is a much different way of life than the autopilot approach in which the individual carries out his daily routines and activities. In studies, mindfulness is examined not only to prevent the recurrence of addiction, but also as a long-term, ongoing health behavior that supports the recovery of addiction. Determining the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention program applied to adolescent nursing students studying at a university on internet addiction and awareness. is intended."

Training on Toxic Stress in Newborns will be given to both groups, and then a post-training knowledge test (2nd Test) will be administered. The initiative group will be composed of students who apply concept maps and make in-class maintenance plans after theoretical training. The control group will consist of students who receive theoretical training and implement in-class care plans. After the concept map application, a knowledge test will be applied again (3rd Test).\n\nThe data of the research will be collected with the Personal Information Form and Newborn Toxic Stress Information Test.\n\nThe personal information form was prepared by the researchers. In shape; There are questions about the student"s age, gender, secondary school graduation status, whether they choose the nursing profession willingly, whether they consider the nursing profession suitable for themselves, whether they have heard the term concept map and whether they have applied concept map.\n\nNewborn Toxic Stress Information Test was prepared by researchers. The test consists of 25 multiple choice questions. It consists of true, false and I don"t know options."

Elevated circulating homocysteine is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and occlusive disorders. Our study is to investigate the association between elevated blood homocysteine levels and complications in pregnant women in order to conclude the clinical utility of homocysteine as a marker of severity in the cases of pre-eclampsia.",
              "DetailedDescription": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among mothers and infants. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder occurring usually after 20 weeks of gestation. It is associated with fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm birth, respiratory distress syndrome, and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. According to a systemic review and meta-analysis published in 2013, preeclampsia has a noticeable relationship with an increased risk of developing hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular accident in later life.\n\nThere is already abundant evidence indicating that elevated serum homocysteine levels may be related to the risk of coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial diseases. Elevated circulating homocysteine is a risk factor of endothelial dysfunction and vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and occlusive disorders. Normally, homocysteine levels decline throughout pregnancy and since the vascular alterations brought on by homocysteine are comparable to those brought on by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, it can be assumed that high levels of homocysteine are linked to the hypertensive disorder spectrum. Homocysteine has been shown to produce oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, endothelial cell injury and thrombus formation and thereby producing pre-eclampsia.\n\nEstimation of homocysteine may help to predict and prevent pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, thus reducing the undesired outcome of pregnancy.\n\nAmong various studies, there is a lack of consistency in the reported results that support the link between maternal homocysteine concentrations assessed throughout each of the three trimesters of pregnancy and difficulties caused by the placenta.\n\nour study investigate the relation between the level of homocysteine and severity of preeclampsia."
