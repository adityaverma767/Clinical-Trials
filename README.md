**Introduction**
This project processes clinical data from https://clinicaltrials.gov/. Specifically focusing on returning estimated or actual enrollment for studies. It can also add functionality from the given date range filter.

**Installation**
Clone the repository: 

  git clone https://github.com/adityaverma767/Clinical-Trials.git
  
  cd Clinical-Trials

Run the program:

  python main.py

**Limitations**

The current version does not support accessing older versions of the API, so the estimated enrollment cannot be found for completed studies.
